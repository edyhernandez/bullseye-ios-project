    var currentValue = 0 // This is a variable I created. It's initially set to 50 and will stay that way until I move the slider around. It will stay active so long as the app is running. Look up scopes for more information. Note: This used to say var currentValue: Int = 0. Same for the variable right below this one!
    
    var targetValue = 0 // This declares a new instance variable called "targetValue" to the app. It starts off as Zero (the zero is never used) and gets replaced by the random number chosen by the random generator found below in the viewDidLoad method found below.
    
    var score = 0 // This is a new instance variable that will keep track of the player's score. Swift uses something called "Type Inference" to figure out what type of data this variable should use and, since 0 is a whole number, it will figure out that score should be an integer, and therefore automatically gives it the type Int! Cool!
    
    var round = 0 // An instance variable that keeps track of what round you're in the game.
